Hi, this is Gian, and welcome to my blog! I am an experienced ML engineer and technical leader with a strong background in software development, focusing on Machine Learning and DL since 2017.  
I bring a unique blend of hands-on coding expertise and strategic vision, crafting scalable AI solutions for real-world applications.  
My expertise includes fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), distributed inference on multi-GPU/multi-node setups, and developing scalable AI architectures.  
Passionate about driving innovation through AI, I place a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and compliance in regulated environments.  
Whether developing real-time collaboration tools or architecting multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, I focus on delivering AI solutions that drive  
business innovation.

### My Journey &amp; Background

Despite not holding a formal university degree, my career is built on relentless curiosity and self-taught expertise. I started programming at the age of 8, driven solely by passion for technology. I still remember my very first programming exam—coding in BASIC for the Commodore 64. The task was to implement the Pythagorean theorem, and even though I was too young to have learned it at school, I managed to get it right. Over the years, I’ve led and mentored several teams of engineers, proving that real-world skills and continuous learning can pave the way to leadership and innovation.
