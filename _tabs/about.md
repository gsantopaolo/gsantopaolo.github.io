Hi, I'm **Gian Paolo Santopaolo**—welcome to my blog!

I'm a **Senior Generative AI Engineer** focused on building production-grade multimodal and RAG systems. I work daily with Python and PyTorch and deliver AI solutions from research prototypes to scalable deployments.

I developed **[CogniX](https://github.com/gen-mind/cognix?utm_source=genmind.ch)**, an enterprise RAG platform and multimodal AI stack, and integrated generative AI (LLMs, diffusion, vision, speech, OCR) into **Collaboard**, a real-time collaboration product used worldwide.

I've designed and deployed into production multiple **agentic and generative AI systems**, including **[ReforgeAI](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/reforge-ai?utm_source=genmind.ch)** (legacy code modernization), **[Sentinel-AI](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/sentinel-AI?utm_source=genmind.ch)** (event monitoring), **[CreativeCampaign-Agent](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent?utm_source=genmind.ch)** (marketing automation), and **[DeltaE](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/DeltaE?utm_source=genmind.ch)** (color correction for fashion AI).
