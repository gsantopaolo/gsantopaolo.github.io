Hi, I'm **Gian Paolo Santopaolo**—welcome to my blog!

I'm a **Senior Generative AI Engineer** with **18+ years** in software engineering and architecture, and a deep focus on **generative AI, multimodal learning, and RAG systems** since 2017. I write Python and PyTorch daily, owning open-source and internal AI codebases from research prototype to production deployment.

I led development of **CogniX**, an open-source multimodal RAG platform, and integrated generative AI (text, image, vision, speech, object detection) into **Collaboard**, a real-time collaboration product serving users worldwide.

I've designed and deployed into production multiple **agentic and generative AI systems**, including **ReforgeAI** (legacy code modernization), **Sentinel-AI** (event monitoring), **CreativeCampaign-Agent** (marketing automation), and **DeltaE** (color correction for fashion AI).

## What I Build

I specialize in taking AI from research prototypes to **production-grade systems**:

✅ **Event-driven microservices** for AI workloads  
✅ **Multi-GPU distributed inference** at scale  
✅ **RAG platforms** with vector search (Qdrant, Milvus)  
✅ **Agentic systems** using CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph  
✅ **Model fine-tuning pipelines** with proper evaluation  
✅ **End-to-end observability** for AI services

I've shipped AI features to **millions of users** and built open-source projects that demonstrate production engineering patterns.
