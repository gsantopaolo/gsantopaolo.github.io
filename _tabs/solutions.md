## Core AI Solutions

### RAG Pipelines
Build virtual assistants grounded in your proprietary data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines large language models with internal knowledge bases to deliver accurate, context-aware responses with source attribution.

**Example Use Case:** Enterprise chatbot for answering internal policy queries across HR, compliance, and operations—returning relevant information with references to source documents.

**Tech Stack:** LangChain/LangGraph, Qdrant/Milvus, FastAPI, event-driven microservices

---

### Model Fine-Tuning
When off-the-shelf models fall short, fine-tune LLMs and diffusion models on proprietary data to match your brand voice, domain terminology, and specific requirements. Production experience with multimodal models (Pixtral text+vision), embedding models, and custom diffusion models (Flux, Stable Diffusion).

**Example Use Case:** Generate consistent, on-brand marketing copy and technical reports using fine-tuned models that understand industry-specific terminology and house style.

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, Weights & Biases, Azure ML/AWS SageMaker

---

### AI Task Optimization
Build cost-effective, task-specific generative systems using advanced prompt engineering, sampling techniques, and structured outputs. Often faster and more economical than fine-tuning while delivering production-grade consistency.

**Example Use Case:** Automated quality checks on client deliverables—enforcing style guides, catching errors, and ensuring compliance before submission.

**Tech Stack:** GPT-4/Claude, structured output validation, FastAPI microservices

---

### AI Agents
Deploy autonomous agentic systems that plan, make decisions, and take action using external tools. Production experience with CrewAI, Microsoft AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and LangGraph. Built with enterprise-grade security, governance, and human-in-the-loop controls.

**Example Use Case:** Automated employee onboarding agent that sets up accounts, schedules meetings, assigns tasks, answers questions, and tracks completion—with manager approval checkpoints.

**Tech Stack:** CrewAI, LangGraph, NATS event bus, Kubernetes, comprehensive observability

---

### Intelligent AI Workflows
Enhance structured business workflows with generative AI to handle tasks requiring reasoning, creativity, or context interpretation. Systems follow predefined orchestration patterns while incorporating AI for analysis, summarization, and content generation.

**Example Use Case:** Scale customer feedback analysis—automatically categorize comments, identify themes, generate executive summaries, and route insights to relevant teams with sentiment scoring.

**Tech Stack:** Event-driven microservices (NATS, Kafka), LangChain orchestration, PostgreSQL/CockroachDB

---

### Workflow Automation
Automate rule-based, structured processes for maximum efficiency and accuracy. Execute fixed logic using integrated tools, APIs, and databases—running on-demand or scheduled. Ideal for predictable tasks without interpretation requirements.

**Example Use Case:** Streamline invoice processing—match incoming invoices against purchase orders, flag discrepancies, auto-approve within thresholds, and schedule payments with audit trails.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, event-driven architecture, integration with ERPs and payment systems

---

## Advanced AI Capabilities

### Multimodal AI Systems
Deploy production-grade computer vision, OCR, and document intelligence solutions. Experience includes DeepSeek-OCR, SmolDocling, Tesseract, custom-trained YOLO models, Whisper speech recognition, and vision-language models for multimodal understanding.

**Example Use Case:** Automated document processing pipeline extracting structured data from invoices, receipts, and contracts—handling multiple languages, complex layouts, and table extraction at scale.

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenCV, custom CNNs, Segformer, Vision Transformers

---

### Computer Vision Solutions
Custom computer vision pipelines from segmentation to image generation. Production deployments include color-accurate fashion AI (DeltaE), custom object detection (YOLO fine-tuning), semantic segmentation, and generative models for creative workflows.

**Example Use Case:** AI-powered quality control for manufacturing—detecting defects, measuring tolerances, and classifying products in real-time with 99%+ accuracy on production lines.

**Tech Stack:** PyTorch, Segformer, YOLO, Stable Diffusion/Flux, DALL·E 3, custom training pipelines

---

### Distributed AI Infrastructure
Design and deploy production AI infrastructure on Kubernetes with multi-GPU distributed inference, horizontal scaling, and comprehensive observability. Experience with bare-metal clusters, cloud providers (Azure AKS, AWS EKS, GCP GKE), and GPU cloud (Lambda Labs, RunPod).

**Example Use Case:** Multi-GPU inference cluster serving 100M+ users—distributed load balancing, autoscaling, A/B testing, and sub-100ms latency with Grafana/Prometheus/Loki monitoring.

**Tech Stack:** Kubernetes, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, vLLM, Hugging Face TGI, NATS, MinIO/S3, observability stack

---

### AI System Modernization
Modernize legacy systems with AI-powered code analysis, migration planning, and automated refactoring. Production experience with agentic systems (ReforgeAI) that analyze Java codebases, generate documentation, create transformation plans, and execute Spring Boot migrations at scale.

**Example Use Case:** Legacy Java application modernization—automated analysis of 500K+ lines of code, dependency upgrades, framework migration to Spring Boot, security hardening, and comprehensive documentation generation.

**Tech Stack:** CrewAI multi-agent orchestration, AST parsing, code analysis tools, LangChain, GPT-4
