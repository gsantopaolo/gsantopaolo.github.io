## Freelance Consulting

[Book a Call](https://calendar.app.google/QuNua7HxdsSasCGu9){: .btn .btn-primary} | [Email Me](mailto:gianpaolo.santopaolo@gmail.com)

I can help with your AI project. With 24+ years in software engineering and deep expertise in production-grade AI systems—from custom neural architectures and LLM fine-tuning to RAG platforms and agentic pipelines—I've built AI solutions serving 100+ million users.

I've developed **[CogniX](https://github.com/gen-mind/cognix)** (enterprise RAG platform), integrated generative AI into **Collaboard** (real-time collaboration product used worldwide), and deployed multiple agentic systems including **[ReforgeAI](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/reforge-ai)**, **[Sentinel-AI](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/sentinel-AI)**, and **[CreativeCampaign-Agent](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent)**.

I work daily with PyTorch, delivering AI solutions from research prototypes to scalable, multi-GPU deployments. My expertise spans:

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch expert, LLM/diffusion model fine-tuning, custom architectures
- **Production AI**: Multi-GPU distributed inference, RAG systems, agentic pipelines
- **Infrastructure**: Bare-metal Kubernetes, Azure/AWS/GCP, model serving at scale
- **Full-stack AI**: FastAPI, Streamlit/Gradio, observability, CI/CD

**Here's the thing**: If I told you I like your project, that means I would love to jump in and work out whatever you'll throw at me. I don't do surface-level consulting—I roll up my sleeves and build alongside your team.

I diagnose the problem and tell you what to fix, fast.

### Good for:

- ✓ "Our serving latency is killing us"
- ✓ "Is our training pipeline set up correctly?"
- ✓ "We're about to launch – what are we missing?"
- ✓ Pre-investment technical due diligence

### What you get:

- • 30-minute scoping call to understand the problem
- • Async review of your architecture, code, and docs
- • Action list: 3-5 prioritized fixes with implementation notes
- • 30-minute debrief to answer questions and clarify next steps

**Duration**: ~1 week

## Comprehensive Audit

[Book an Intro Call](https://calendar.app.google/QuNua7HxdsSasCGu9){: .btn .btn-primary} | [Email Me](mailto:gianpaolo.santopaolo@gmail.com)

I assess your entire ML stack and build a roadmap to fix it.

### Good for:

- ✓ Platform-wide health check before major investment
- ✓ Leadership wanting an outside perspective on systemic issues
- ✓ Teams inheriting legacy ML systems
- ✓ Post-mortem after a failed ML initiative

### What you get:

- • Everything in the Focused Review, but across multiple systems
- • Stakeholder interviews with engineering, product, and leadership
- • Formal written report: technical findings, organizational gaps, and risk assessment
- • 6-month roadmap with effort estimates, dependencies, and sequencing
- • Follow-up call 4 weeks later to check progress

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

## Questions?

**What if I'm not sure which tier I need?**  
Start with an advisory call. We'll figure out the right scope together.

**Do you sign NDAs?**  
Yes, happy to sign a mutual NDA before we discuss anything sensitive.

**Can you help with implementation after the review?**  
Absolutely. My focus is on delivering value—whether that's through guidance, hands-on development, or both. Let's discuss what makes sense for your situation.
