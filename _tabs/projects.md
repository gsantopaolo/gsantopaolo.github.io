# CogniX
CogniX is an enterprise-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, designed to manage and semantically analyze millions of documents with precision and efficiency. It represents the forefront of document understanding technology, making it an invaluable tool for businesses dealing with large volumes of informations.
## How It Works
- **Semantic Analysis:** CogniX applies advanced semantic analysis to understand the meaning of documents beyond just keywords. This deep understanding allows for more accurate retrieval of information.
- **Vector Database Storage:** The essence of each document's meaning is transformed into a mathematical vector and stored in a vector database. This ensures that searches are not just fast but incredibly relevant.
- **Focused Retrieval:** Whether you're dealing with documents about apple harvesting or apple recipes, CogniX can discern and retrieve precisely what you're looking for. For instance, a query about apple harvests will only bring up relevant documents, leaving unrelated ones, like apple recipes, behind.
## Advanced Capabilities
- **Document Chunking and Embedding:** By breaking down documents and embedding their content using semantic machine-learning models trained on everyday language, CogniX ensures that even the most complex documents are made searchable.
- **Support for Local LLMs:** With our powerful inference server, CogniX supports high-performance text generation across a wide range of popular open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), including Mixtral, Llama, Falcon, StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, and T5.
- **Fine-Tuning for Precision:** While CogniX demonstrates robust capabilities, there's also the potential for fine-tuning models to specific domains, such as legal documents in multiple languages, to achieve even more precise results.
