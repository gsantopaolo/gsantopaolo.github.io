*Coming soon: Best practices for building reliable, secure, and performant tools for AI agents...*

<!-- This post will cover:
- Tool design principles (clear inputs/outputs, error handling)
- Security patterns (sandboxing, input validation, rate limiting)
- Performance optimization (caching, async execution, batching)
- Observability (logging, tracing, metrics)
- Testing strategies for AI-driven tool usage
- Real-world tool libraries (search, calculation, database, API calls)
- When to build custom vs. use pre-built tools
- Tool composition and chaining
-->
