I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Microsoft Headquarters in Redmond, WA, where I reconnected with my old friend Nikola Metulev at the Windows Building on campus.

Nikola and I share a deep passion for Natural User Interfaces (NUI), and despite our unplanned meeting, our conversation naturally evolved into a fascinating discussion about the latest trends and innovations in NUI. In fact, we were so inspired that we decided to dedicate an episode of #ifdef to exploring this topic further.

It was a truly enjoyable and enriching experience!
