If you landed here, you're probably already using a remote (GPU) for your ML tasks, and you're sick of git push from your laptop and the pull on your
powerful GPU machine. Ask me why I know that, and you're probably a PyCharm fan as well ðŸ˜Š.
<br />
If so, you landed in the right place.
<br />
On the web there are several guide how to do remote dev for VS code, but I haven't found one that works for PyCharm, so I decided to write this post.

## Introduction

Welcome aboard the world of **SSH-based remote development** with PyCharm! <br /> Imagine editing your DNN locally in PyCharm 
while harnessing the power of a remote Linux serverâ€”be it a GPU instance on Runpod, a cluster on Lambda AI, a bare-metal GPU box at Hetzner, or the new [Shadeform.ai](https://www.shadeform.ai?utm_source=genmind.ch) marketplace. 
With a secure SSH tunnel, you get:

* **Massive compute on demand**
* **Consistent, shareable environments**
* **Code safety**â€”your laptop stays light!

No more fighting environment drift or lugging heavyweight workstations. 
In this guide, weâ€™ll cover every SSH-specific step from host prerequisites to remote interpreter setup, 
plus tips on squeezing GPU performance from budget-friendly servers. Letâ€™s supercharge your Python workflow! ([runpod.io][4], [lambda.ai][5], [hetzner.com][6], [shadeform.ai][7])

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure your remote host meets PyCharmâ€™s requirements:

* **CPU & RAM**: â‰¥ 4 vCPUs (x86\_64 or arm64), 8 GB RAM. Higher clock speeds beat more cores for this use case.
* **Disk**: \~10 GB free on local or block storage (avoid NFS/SMB).
* **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04, CentOS, Debian, or RHEL.
* **Python & SSH**: A running OpenSSH server on your Linux box and the desired Python version (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3` or a virtualenv).
* **Your public SSH key**: must be deployed on the server. If you are running on Runpod, Lambda, Hetzner, it shall be automatically deployed
* **PyCharm version**: this guide applies to PyCharm 2025.1

## Open SSH Configurations

   * On the bottom-left corner of the IDE click on  **Current Interpreter â–¸ Add New Interpreter â–¸ On SSH** and click **Create SSH configuration**.

_Create SSH configuration_

## Fill in Connection Details
   * **Host**: your serverâ€™s IP or hostname
   * **Port**: usually `22` (or custom)
   * **Username**: your SSH user
   * click next
<br />
![Connection Details](/content/2025/06/pycharm2.jpg){: width="500" height="400" }
_fill in the connection details_

## Fill in Auth Details
   * **Select**: Key pair and browse for your private SSH key. On a Mac the default location is YOUR_USER/.ssh . It's a hidden folder - Command + Shift + . (period) to show hidden folders on your pop up, if they are not already shown.
   * **Fill the passphrase**: if your SSH private key weas generated with a passphrase. 
   * **Select Save passphrase** 
   * Click **Next**.

## Introspecting SSH server
   * If you filled all your params correctly you shall see a blank box, just click next

## Project directory and Python runtime configuration
   * Select the same environment you use locally
   * I leave all the other params as default
   * Click Create
<br />

## Running, Testing & Debugging Remotely

* **Run Configurations**
  Your existing Run/Debug configs automatically use the SSH interpreter.
* **Breakpoints & Console**
  Set breakpoints locally; the debugger runs over SSH, showing remote stack frames and variables.
* **Remote Python Console**
  Open a Python console that executes commands on the server.

## Deployment & Remote Host Tool Window

* **Auto-Upload on Save**
  * When you make a change to your code, it is automatically deployed to the server; nothing else you have to care about
  * You write code on your laptop, and it gets automatically executed on your GPU server!
  * Optionally, you may want to open a terminal on your GPU server. On the bottom left of the IDE click on **Terminal** and on the drop down choose your newly created SSH connection
<br />

## Licensing & Limitations

* **License**
  SSH interpreters require PyCharm **Professional** (Community Edition doesnâ€™t support them).
* **Limitations**
  Only Linux servers are supported as SSH backends; no remote Windows/macOS interpreters yet, but hey, I hope you are not using a Windows server to test your ML projects!.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **SSH Connection Errors**
  Verify firewall rules, the correct port, and test with `ssh -v user@host`.
* **Interpreter Setup Failures**
  Ensure the SSH config is selected in the SSH Interpreter wizard; see JetBrains support threads for similar issues ([intellij-support.jetbrains.com][13]).
* **Performance Tuning**
  If the remote IDE backend lags, increase its JVM heap in `~/.cache/JetBrains/RemoteDev/*.vmoptions`.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Youâ€™ve now unlocked the ability to **code from anywhere**, tapping into remote CPUs or GPUs without leaving PyCharm. ðŸš€ Next, you might explore:

* **Container-based development** (Docker, Kubernetes)
* **JetBrains Gateway** for zero-install remote work
* **Collaborative coding** via Code With Me


As for compute, cost-effective GPU backends:
- Runpod (pay-per-second from \$0.00011/s) ([runpod.io][4]), 
- Lambda AI (H100 at \$1.85/hr) ([lambda.ai][5]) 
- Hetzner bare-metal GPUs (e.g. RTX-powered servers from â‚¬0.295/hr) ([hetzner.com][6])
- The Shadeform.ai marketplace (A100 80 GB PCIe at \$1.20/hr up to H200 SXM5 at \$2.45/hr) ([shadeform.ai][7]).
