When dealing with deep learning, we quickly encounter the word **tensor**. But what exactly is a tensor? Is it just a fancy name for an array? A mathematical object from physics? Both?

This guide takes you on a journey from intuitive understanding to practical implementation. We'll explore tensors through four lenses:

1. **[The intuitive view](#building-intuition--vectors-and-tensors-explained)**: Understanding vectors and tensors through Dan Fleisch's brilliant explanation
2. **[The computational view](#tensors-in-numpy--from-theory-to-arrays)**: How NumPy handles multi-dimensional arrays
3. **[The ML practitioner's view](#tensors-in-pytorch--the-ml-practitioners-toolkit)**: Working with tensors in PyTorch

## Building Intuition — Vectors and Tensors Explained

> *"What's a tensor?"* — The question Dan Fleisch set out to answer in his book - A Student's Guide to Vectors and Tensors


The best route to understanding tensors starts with understanding **vectors**. Not just as "arrays of numbers," but as geometric objects with components and basis vectors.

### Understanding Vectors Through Components

Think of a 3D Cartesian coordinate system with x, y, and z axes. This coordinate system comes with **basis vectors** (unit vectors):

- **x̂** (or **e**ₓ): unit vector in the x direction
- **ŷ** (or **e**ᵧ): unit vector in the y direction  
- **ẑ** (or **e**ᵤ): unit vector in the z direction

Each basis vector has **length 1** and points along its axis.

Any vector **A** in 3D space can be written as:

**A** = Aₓ x̂ + Aᵧ ŷ + Aᵤ ẑ

Where:
- (Aₓ, Aᵧ, Aᵤ) are the **components** — the numbers
- (x̂, ŷ, ẑ) are the **basis vectors** — the directions

### Visualizing Vector Components

Dan Fleisch uses a beautiful analogy: imagine shining a light perpendicular to an axis. The shadow the vector casts on that axis is its component along that direction.

To find the **x-component**: shine light parallel to the y-axis (perpendicular to x). The shadow on the x-axis is Aₓ.

_Projections using light sources perpendicular to x- and y-axes - image source [A Student's Guide to Vectors and Tensors](https://www4.danfleisch.com/sgvt/)_


Alternatively, think of it as: *"How many x̂ unit vectors and how many ŷ unit vectors would it take to get from the base to the tip of this vector?"*

This is profound because it reveals:

> **A vector is a geometric object.**  
> **Components depend on your coordinate system; the vector itself does not.**

If you rotate your coordinate system, both the basis vectors *and* the components change — but the actual arrow in space remains the same.

### From Vectors to Tensors: The Rank System

Now we can understand the classification:

- **Scalar** (rank-0 tensor): No directional information, no index needed
  - Example: temperature = 42
  
- **Vector** (rank-1 tensor): One directional indicator, **one index**
  - Components: Aᵢ where i ∈ {x, y, z}
  - Example: velocity = [3, 4, 0]

- **Rank-2 tensor**: Two directional indicators, **two indices**
  - Components: Tᵢⱼ where i, j ∈ {x, y, z}
  - In 3D: 3 × 3 = 9 components
  - Example: stress tensor, Jacobian matrix

- **Rank-3 tensor**: Three directional indicators, **three indices**
  - Components: Tᵢⱼₖ where i, j, k ∈ {x, y, z}
  - In 3D: 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 components

### Why Do We Need Higher-Rank Tensors?

Consider **stress** inside a solid object. You might have surfaces with area vectors pointing in the x, y, or z direction. On each surface, forces can act in the x, y, or z direction.

To fully characterize all possible forces on all possible surfaces, you need **9 components** with **two indices**:

- Tₓₓ: x-directed force on a surface whose normal points in x
- Tᵧₓ: x-directed force on a surface whose normal points in y
- And so on...

This is a **rank-2 tensor** — the stress tensor.

### The Power of Tensors: Coordinate Independence

Here's what makes tensors "the facts of the universe" (as mathematician Lillian Lieber called them):

> **All observers, in all reference frames, agree on the combination of components and basis vectors.**

They may disagree on the individual components, and on what the basis vectors are, but the components transform in just such a way to keep the combined result (the actual tensor) the same for everyone.

This is why tensors appear everywhere in physics: they express physical laws in a coordinate-free way that all observers agree on.

## Tensors in NumPy — From Theory to Arrays

Now let's bring this down to code. In practice, when we work with tensors in machine learning, we're working with **multi-dimensional arrays**.

### The Hierarchy: Scalar to N-D Tensor

NumPy provides the perfect bridge between mathematical concepts and computational reality with its `ndarray` (n-dimensional array).

**Scalar (Rank 0)**

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array(42)
print(x)
print(f'A scalar is of rank {x.ndim}')
# Output:
# 42
# A scalar is of rank 0
```

**Vector (Rank 1)**

```python
x = np.array([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8])
print(x)
print(f'A vector is of rank {x.ndim}')
# Output:
# [1 1 2 3 5 8]
# A vector is of rank 1
```

**Matrix (Rank 2)**

```python
x = np.array([[1, 4, 7],
              [2, 5, 8],
              [3, 6, 9]])
print(x)
print(f'A matrix is of rank {x.ndim}')
# Output:
# [[1 4 7]
#  [2 5 8]
#  [3 6 9]]
# A matrix is of rank 2
```

**3D Tensor (Rank 3)**

```python
x = np.array([[[1, 4, 7],
               [2, 5, 8],
               [3, 6, 9]],
              
              [[10, 40, 70],
               [20, 50, 80],
               [30, 60, 90]],
              
              [[100, 400, 700],
               [200, 500, 800],
               [300, 600, 900]]])

print(x)
print(f'This tensor is of rank {x.ndim}')
# Output: This tensor is of rank 3
```

### Important Distinction: Terminology

In practice, when we say "tensor" in ML, we typically mean **rank-3 or higher** to avoid confusion. Calling the scalar `42` a "tensor" is technically correct but not helpful.

Mathematically speaking, tensors are more than simply a data container. Aside from holding numeric data, tensors also include descriptions of the valid linear transformations between tensors (like cross product and dot product). From a computer science perspective, tensors can be thought of as objects in an object-oriented sense, not just data structures.

## Tensors in PyTorch — The ML Practitioner's Toolkit

PyTorch tensors are where theory meets practice in modern deep learning. They're similar to NumPy arrays but with superpowers.

### What Makes PyTorch Tensors Special?

From [PyTorch's documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html):

> *"Tensors are a specialized data structure that are very similar to arrays and matrices. In PyTorch, we use tensors to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the model's parameters."*

**PyTorch Tensor = NumPy Array + GPU Acceleration + Automatic Differentiation**

Key differences from NumPy:
- Tensors can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators
- Tensors and NumPy arrays can often share the same underlying memory
- Tensors are optimized for automatic differentiation (crucial for backpropagation)

### Creating Tensors in PyTorch

**1. Directly from Python Data**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Directly from lists
data = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
x_data = torch.tensor(data)
print(x_data)
# Output:
# tensor([[1, 2],
#         [3, 4]])
```

**2. From NumPy Arrays**

```python
np_array = np.array(data)
x_np = torch.from_numpy(np_array)

# Tensors and NumPy arrays can share memory!
# Changes to one can affect the other (when on CPU)
```

**3. From Another Tensor**

```python
x_ones = torch.ones_like(x_data)  # Retains shape, changes values
print(f"Ones Tensor:\n {x_ones}\n")

x_rand = torch.rand_like(x_data, dtype=torch.float)  # Override datatype
print(f"Random Tensor:\n {x_rand}\n")
```

**4. With Specified Shapes**

```python
shape = (2, 3)  # 2 rows, 3 columns
rand_tensor = torch.rand(shape)
ones_tensor = torch.ones(shape)
zeros_tensor = torch.zeros(shape)

print(f"Random Tensor:\n {rand_tensor}\n")
print(f"Ones Tensor:\n {ones_tensor}\n")
print(f"Zeros Tensor:\n {zeros_tensor}")

# Output:
# Random Tensor:
#  tensor([[0.4122, 0.1048, 0.6723],
#          [0.0083, 0.1560, 0.6437]])
# 
# Ones Tensor:
#  tensor([[1., 1., 1.],
#          [1., 1., 1.]])
# 
# Zeros Tensor:
#  tensor([[0., 0., 0.],
#          [0., 0., 0.]])
```

### Tensor Attributes: Shape, Datatype, Device

Every tensor has three crucial attributes:

```python
tensor = torch.rand(3, 4)

print(f"Shape: {tensor.shape}")           # torch.Size([3, 4])
print(f"Datatype: {tensor.dtype}")        # torch.float32
print(f"Device: {tensor.device}")         # cuda, mps or cpu
```

These attributes tell you:
- **Shape**: The dimensions of the tensor
- **Datatype**: The data type of elements (float32, int64, etc.)
- **Device**: Where the tensor is stored (GPU or CPU)

### Moving Tensors to GPU/Accelerator

One of PyTorch's killer features is seamless CPU-GPU operations:

```python
# Check for accelerator availability and move tensor
if torch.accelerator.is_available():
    tensor = tensor.to(torch.accelerator.current_accelerator())
    print(f"Device: {tensor.device}")  # cuda:0 or mps:0

# Or specifically for CUDA
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    tensor = tensor.to('cuda')
```
> Copying large tensors across devices is expensive in terms of time and memory!

### Essential Tensor Operations

PyTorch offers over 1200 tensor operations, including arithmetic, linear algebra, matrix manipulation, sampling, and more.

**Indexing and Slicing (NumPy-style)**

```python
tensor = torch.ones(4, 4)

print(f"First row: {tensor[0]}")        # First row
print(f"First column: {tensor[:, 0]}")  # First column
print(f"Last column: {tensor[..., -1]}")  # Last column

# In-place modification
tensor[:, 1] = 0
print(tensor)
# Output:
# tensor([[1., 0., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 0., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 0., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 0., 1., 1.]])
```

**Joining Tensors**

```python
# Concatenate along dimension 1 (columns)
t1 = torch.cat([tensor, tensor, tensor], dim=1)
print(t1)
# Output: 4 rows, 12 columns (3x the original width)

# Stack creates a new dimension
t2 = torch.stack([tensor, tensor, tensor], dim=0)
# Output: [3, 4, 4] - stacks along new first dimension
```

**Arithmetic Operations**

```python
# Matrix multiplication
y1 = tensor @ tensor.T
y2 = tensor.matmul(tensor.T)

y3 = torch.rand_like(y1)
torch.matmul(tensor, tensor.T, out=y3)  # In-place result

# Element-wise product
z1 = tensor * tensor
z2 = tensor.mul(tensor)

z3 = torch.rand_like(tensor)
torch.mul(tensor, tensor, out=z3)  # In-place result
```

**Single-element Tensors**

```python
# Aggregation to scalar
agg = tensor.sum()
agg_item = agg.item()  # Convert to Python number
print(agg_item, type(agg_item))  # 12.0 <class 'float'>
```

**In-place Operations**

```python
# Operations with _ suffix modify tensors in-place
tensor.add_(5)  # Adds 5 to every element
tensor.mul_(2)  # Multiplies every element by 2

# Warning: In-place ops save memory but can cause issues
# with automatic differentiation!
```

### Tensor Shapes in Deep Learning

Understanding tensor shapes is crucial for debugging neural networks:

| Data Type | Tensor Shape | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Image (RGB)** | `[3, 224, 224]` | 3 channels, 224×224 pixels |
| **Batch of Images** | `[32, 3, 224, 224]` | 32 images in batch |
| **Text Sequence** | `[batch, seq_len]` | Token IDs |
| **Embeddings** | `[batch, seq_len, embed_dim]` | Word vectors |
| **Video** | `[batch, frames, channels, H, W]` | Video clips |

### Common Tensor Transformations

**Reshaping**

```python
x = torch.randn(8, 16)
y = x.view(4, 32)      # Must have same number of elements
                       # Must be contiguous in memory

z = x.reshape(2, 4, 16)  # More flexible, may copy data
                         # Works even if not contiguous
```

**Permuting Dimensions**

```python
x = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)  # [N, C, H, W]
x_perm = x.permute(0, 2, 3, 1)    # [N, H, W, C]
# Useful for converting between different frameworks
```

**Squeezing and Unsqueezing**

```python
x = torch.randn(1, 28, 28)
y = x.squeeze(0)      # Remove dimension 0: [28, 28]
z = y.unsqueeze(0)    # Add dimension 0: [1, 28, 28]

# Common use: adding batch dimension
batch_x = x.unsqueeze(0)  # [1, 28, 28] -> [1, 1, 28, 28]
```

**Broadcasting**

```python
# PyTorch automatically broadcasts tensors with compatible shapes
x = torch.randn(3, 4)
y = torch.randn(4)     # Can broadcast to [3, 4]
z = x + y              # y is broadcast to each row

# Broadcast rules:
# - Dimensions are aligned from right to left
# - Dimensions of size 1 can be broadcast to any size
# - Missing dimensions are added on the left
```

## The ML Pipeline — Tensors in Action

Let's see how tensors flow through a typical deep learning workflow:

### Complete Example: Image Classification

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# 1. Data as tensors
# Batch of 32 RGB images, 224x224 pixels
images = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)  
labels = torch.randint(0, 1000, (32,))  # 32 class labels (ImageNet)

# 2. Model with tensor parameters
class SimpleConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * 56 * 56, 512)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 1000)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: [32, 3, 224, 224]
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))  # [32, 64, 112, 112]
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))  # [32, 128, 56, 56]
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)             # [32, 128*56*56] flatten
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))                # [32, 512]
        x = self.fc2(x)                        # [32, 1000]
        return x

model = SimpleConvNet()

# 3. Forward pass: tensor operations
outputs = model(images)  # Shape: [32, 1000]
print(f"Output shape: {outputs.shape}")

# 4. Loss computation: tensor to scalar
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")  # Convert tensor to Python float

# 5. Backpropagation (automatic differentiation)
loss.backward()  # Computes gradients for all parameters

# 6. Access gradients (also tensors!)
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"{name}: {param.grad.shape}")
```

### Common Tensor Operations in Deep Learning

**Normalization**

```python
# Batch normalization expects [N, C, H, W]
x = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)

# Normalize per channel
mean = x.mean(dim=[0, 2, 3], keepdim=True)  # [1, 3, 1, 1]
std = x.std(dim=[0, 2, 3], keepdim=True)
x_norm = (x - mean) / (std + 1e-5)
```

**Attention Mechanism**

```python
# Simplified attention computation
batch, seq_len, d_model = 32, 128, 512

Q = torch.randn(batch, seq_len, d_model)  # Query
K = torch.randn(batch, seq_len, d_model)  # Key
V = torch.randn(batch, seq_len, d_model)  # Value

# Scaled dot-product attention
scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1))  # [32, 128, 128]
scores = scores / (d_model ** 0.5)
attn_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)       # [32, 128, 128]
output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, V)         # [32, 128, 512]
```

**Data Augmentation**

```python
# Example: Random horizontal flip
def random_flip(images):
    # images: [N, C, H, W]
    mask = torch.rand(images.size(0)) > 0.5
    images[mask] = torch.flip(images[mask], dims=[3])  # Flip width
    return images

augmented = random_flip(torch.randn(16, 3, 224, 224))
```

---

## Part 5: Bridge to NumPy and Back

One of PyTorch's strengths is easy interoperability with NumPy:

### Converting Between PyTorch and NumPy

```python
# NumPy to PyTorch
np_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
torch_tensor = torch.from_numpy(np_array)

# PyTorch to NumPy (CPU only)
torch_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
np_array = torch_tensor.numpy()

# Important: They share memory!
np_array[0, 0] = 999
print(torch_tensor)  # Also changed!
```

**GPU Tensors**

```python
# For GPU tensors, must move to CPU first
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    gpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3).cuda()
    np_array = gpu_tensor.cpu().numpy()
```

**With Gradients**

```python
# Tensors with gradients need .detach()
x = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.], requires_grad=True)
# np_array = x.numpy()  # Error!
np_array = x.detach().numpy()  # OK
```

---

## Key Takeaways

### Theoretical Understanding
- **Tensors are geometric objects** characterized by rank (number of indices) and dimension (number of axes)
- **Components change** with coordinate systems, but **tensors themselves don't**
- Tensors are "facts of the universe" — coordinate-independent descriptions of physical/mathematical relationships

### Practical Understanding
- In ML: **Tensor ≈ Multi-dimensional array** with shape, datatype, and device
- **NumPy** provides the foundation for array operations
- **PyTorch tensors** add GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation
- Understanding tensor **shapes** is critical for debugging neural networks

### From Theory to Practice
1. **Scalars** (rank-0): Single numbers
2. **Vectors** (rank-1): 1D arrays with direction
3. **Matrices** (rank-2): 2D grids  
4. **Higher-rank tensors**: 3D, 4D, 5D+ structures for images, video, batches

### Essential Operations
- **Creation**: `torch.tensor()`, `torch.zeros()`, `torch.rand()`
- **Manipulation**: `.view()`, `.reshape()`, `.permute()`
- **Math**: `@`, `.matmul()`, `*`, `.mul()`
- **Reduction**: `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.max()`
- **Device management**: `.to()`, `.cuda()`, `.cpu()`

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Shape Mismatches

```python
# Common error
x = torch.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)
y = torch.randn(32, 1000)
# z = x + y  # Error! Shapes don't match

# Solution: Check shapes
print(f"x: {x.shape}, y: {y.shape}")
```

### Memory Management

```python
# Bad: Creates many intermediate tensors
result = tensor.cpu().numpy().tolist()

# Better: Minimize copies
result = tensor.tolist()  # Direct conversion
```

### In-place Operations and Autograd

```python
x = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.], requires_grad=True)
# x += 1  # Can break autograd!
x = x + 1  # Safe
```

### Device Mismatches

```python
# Error: Tensors on different devices
cpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    gpu_tensor = torch.randn(3, 3).cuda()
    # result = cpu_tensor + gpu_tensor  # Error!
    result = cpu_tensor.cuda() + gpu_tensor  # OK
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Working with Real Images

Let's see tensors in action with real image data. This example shows how to load an image, manipulate it as a tensor, and save the result.

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Load an image and convert it to a tensor
image_path = "test.jpg"
img = Image.open(image_path)

# Convert PIL Image to tensor [C, H, W] with values in [0, 1]
to_tensor = transforms.ToTensor()
img_tensor = to_tensor(img)

print(f"Image tensor shape: {img_tensor.shape}")  # e.g., torch.Size([3, 512, 512])
print(f"Data type: {img_tensor.dtype}")           # torch.float32
print(f"Value range: [{img_tensor.min():.3f}, {img_tensor.max():.3f}]")

# 2. Manipulate the tensor - let's apply some transformations

# Example A: Increase brightness by 30%
brightened = torch.clamp(img_tensor * 1.3, 0, 1)

# Example B: Convert to grayscale (weighted average of RGB channels)
# Standard formula: 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B
weights = torch.tensor([0.299, 0.587, 0.114]).view(3, 1, 1)
grayscale = (img_tensor * weights).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True)
# Broadcast back to 3 channels for saving as RGB
grayscale_rgb = grayscale.repeat(3, 1, 1)

# Example C: Apply a color filter (boost red channel, reduce blue)
color_adjusted = img_tensor.clone()
color_adjusted[0] = torch.clamp(img_tensor[0] * 1.5, 0, 1)  # Red channel
color_adjusted[2] = torch.clamp(img_tensor[2] * 0.5, 0, 1)  # Blue channel

# Example D: Flip image horizontally (flip along width dimension)
flipped = torch.flip(img_tensor, dims=[2])

# Example E: Add some noise
noise = torch.randn_like(img_tensor) * 0.05
noisy = torch.clamp(img_tensor + noise, 0, 1)

# 3. Convert tensors back to PIL Images and save
to_pil = transforms.ToPILImage()

brightened_img = to_pil(brightened)
brightened_img.save("test_brightened.jpg")

grayscale_img = to_pil(grayscale_rgb)
grayscale_img.save("test_grayscale.jpg")

color_adjusted_img = to_pil(color_adjusted)
color_adjusted_img.save("test_color_adjusted.jpg")

flipped_img = to_pil(flipped)
flipped_img.save("test_flipped.jpg")

noisy_img = to_pil(noisy)
noisy_img.save("test_noisy.jpg")

print("\n✓ All manipulated images saved!")

# 4. Visualize the transformations (optional)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(15, 10))
axes = axes.flatten()

images_to_show = [
    (img_tensor, "Original"),
    (brightened, "Brightened (+30%)"),
    (grayscale_rgb, "Grayscale"),
    (color_adjusted, "Color Adjusted"),
    (flipped, "Flipped"),

for ax, (tensor, title) in zip(axes, images_to_show):
    # Convert tensor [C, H, W] to [H, W, C] for matplotlib

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
- **Loading**: PIL Image → Tensor with shape `[C, H, W]`
- **Tensor operations**: Broadcasting, channel manipulation, mathematical operations
- **Clamping**: Keeping values in valid range `[0, 1]`
- **Shape manipulation**: `.repeat()`, `.permute()`, `.flip()`
- **Saving**: Tensor → PIL Image → File

### Exercise 2: Batch Processing Multiple Images

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from pathlib import Path

# Batch process multiple images
image_files = ["test.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]

# Create a batch of tensors
batch_tensors = []
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),  # Standardize size
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

for img_file in image_files:
    if Path(img_file).exists():
        img = Image.open(img_file)
        tensor = transform(img)
        batch_tensors.append(tensor)

# Stack into a single batch tensor [N, C, H, W]
if batch_tensors:
    batch = torch.stack(batch_tensors)
    print(f"Batch shape: {batch.shape}")  # e.g., torch.Size([3, 3, 224, 224])
    
    # Apply transformation to entire batch
    # Example: Normalize using ImageNet statistics
    mean = torch.tensor([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).view(1, 3, 1, 1)
    std = torch.tensor([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).view(1, 3, 1, 1)
    normalized_batch = (batch - mean) / std
    
    print(f"Normalized batch statistics:")
    print(f"  Mean per channel: {normalized_batch.mean(dim=[0, 2, 3])}")
    print(f"  Std per channel: {normalized_batch.std(dim=[0, 2, 3])}")
```

### Exercise 3: Understanding Tensor Shapes with Images

```python
import torch

# Create a batch of 16 random "images" (3 channels, 64x64)
images = torch.randn(16, 3, 64, 64)

print("Original shape:", images.shape)  # torch.Size([16, 3, 64, 64])

# 1. Calculate the mean per channel across the batch
channel_means = images.mean(dim=[0, 2, 3])
print(f"Channel means: {channel_means}")  # Shape: [3]

# 2. Normalize each channel
for c in range(3):
    images[:, c] = (images[:, c] - channel_means[c])

# 3. Reshape to a sequence (flatten spatial dimensions)
sequences = images.view(16, 3, -1)  # [16, 3, 4096]
print(f"Sequence shape: {sequences.shape}")

# 4. Calculate attention-like scores
Q = K = sequences
scores = torch.bmm(Q, K.transpose(1, 2))  # [16, 3, 3]
print(f"Attention scores shape: {scores.shape}")

# 5. Common shape transformations
print("\n--- Shape Transformations ---")
print(f"Original: {images.shape}")
print(f"Flattened: {images.flatten().shape}")  # All dims → 1D
print(f"Permuted (NHWC): {images.permute(0, 2, 3, 1).shape}")  # [N,C,H,W] → [N,H,W,C]
print(f"Squeezed: {images[:1].squeeze().shape}")  # Remove batch dim if size 1
print(f"Unsqueezed: {images.unsqueeze(0).shape}")  # Add new dim at front
```


**The Big Picture:**

Every deep learning model is just tensors flowing through differentiable operations:

```
Image File → Tensor → Neural Network → Output Tensor → Prediction
   (disk)     [N,C,H,W]   (matrix ops)    [N, classes]    (argmax)
```

Master tensors, master deep learning.
