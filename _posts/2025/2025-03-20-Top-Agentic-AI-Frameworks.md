# Technical Comparison of Top Agentic AI Frameworks

In this article, we skip the basics and get straight to the technical details. We first provide a curated list of popular agentic AI frameworks along with links to their repositories. Then, we compare the top four frameworks—Microsoft AutoGen, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, LangChain, and CrewAI—with concrete code examples demonstrating how to build a minimal agent for each.

## Comparing the Top 4 Frameworks

For our technical comparison, we now focus on Microsoft AutoGen, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, LangChain, and CrewAI. We demonstrate minimal examples that illustrate how each framework can be used to define and execute a simple task.

### 1. Microsoft AutoGen

AutoGen is designed for orchestrating multiple agents in an event‑driven, distributed environment. Below is a simplified Python example that demonstrates how you might initialize two collaborating agents that execute a simple function (e.g., data retrieval).

```python
# Example using Microsoft AutoGen (pseudo-code)
from autogen import Agent, TaskOrchestrator

# Define a simple agent function
def fetch_data():
    # Imagine this function retrieves data from an API
    return "Data retrieved"

# Create two agents: one to fetch and one to process
fetch_agent = Agent(name="Fetcher", action=fetch_data)
process_agent = Agent(name="Processor", action=lambda data: f"Processed {data}")

# Orchestrate the agents
orchestrator = TaskOrchestrator(agents=[fetch_agent, process_agent])
result = orchestrator.run()
print(result)  # Expected Output: "Processed Data retrieved"
```

This example shows how AutoGen can connect separate agent functionalities into a single workflow.

### 2. Microsoft Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel enables you to compose “skills”—small, reusable AI functions—into larger workflows. Here’s an example in Python that registers a simple text summarization skill and executes it.

```python
# Example using Microsoft Semantic Kernel
from semantic_kernel import Kernel, Skill

# Initialize the kernel
kernel = Kernel()

# Define a summarization skill
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    # This is a placeholder for an actual summarization model call.
    return "Summary: " + text[:50] + "..."

# Register the skill
kernel.register_skill("TextSummarizer", Skill(function=summarize))

# Execute the skill with sample input
input_text = "This is a long article that needs summarization..."
summary = kernel.run_skill("TextSummarizer", input_text)
print(summary)  # Expected Output: "Summary: This is a long article that needs summar..."
```

Semantic Kernel’s composable design makes it ideal for enterprise applications that require modular AI components.

### 3. LangChain

LangChain excels in building multi‑step workflows by chaining LLM prompts together with memory and tool integration. The following example demonstrates a simple prompt chain that retrieves data and then summarizes it.

```python
# Example using LangChain
from langchain import PromptChain, LLM, Memory

# Initialize an LLM (e.g., GPT-4)
llm = LLM(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define a prompt chain: first retrieve data, then summarize
data_prompt = "Retrieve recent sales data for Q1."
summary_prompt = "Summarize the following sales data: {data}"

# Create a prompt chain with memory to pass output between steps
chain = PromptChain(steps=[
    {"prompt": data_prompt, "output_key": "data"},
    {"prompt": summary_prompt, "input_keys": ["data"], "output_key": "summary"}
], llm=llm, memory=Memory())

result = chain.run()
print(result["summary"])
```

This code illustrates LangChain’s strength in sequentially processing data through chained prompts.

### 4. CrewAI

CrewAI is built for collaborative multi‑agent scenarios where agents assume specialized roles. In this example, we simulate a two-agent team where one agent gathers information and another synthesizes it.

```python
# Example using CrewAI (pseudo-code)
from crewai import Crew, Agent

# Define agent functions
def gather_info():
    # Placeholder: Simulate data gathering
    return "Market analysis data"

def synthesize_info(data):
    # Placeholder: Simulate synthesis of gathered data
    return f"Synthesized Report: {data}"

# Create agents with designated roles
info_agent = Agent(name="InfoGatherer", role="Data Collector", action=gather_info)
report_agent = Agent(name="ReportSynthesizer", role="Analyst", action=lambda: synthesize_info(info_agent.run()))

# Build a crew (team of agents)
crew = Crew(agents=[info_agent, report_agent])

# Run the crew workflow
final_report = crew.execute()
print(final_report)  # Expected Output: "Synthesized Report: Market analysis data"
```

CrewAI’s role-based architecture allows for a clear division of tasks, making it a good fit for applications requiring structured collaboration.
