Fine-tuning large language models can quickly become a tangled mess of code and configuration, especially when 
we're experimenting with different strategies. 

Recently, I rewrote [Teaching an LLM How to Fly a Hot Air Balloon]({% post_url /2023/2023-05-04-teaching-an-llm-how-to-fly-a-hot-air-balloon %}) 
using TRLParser, which lets me separate configuration from the code entirely. 
The result? Cleaner, more maintainable code that lets us switch fine-tuning strategies simply by tweaking a YAML file.


## A Cleaner, More Flexible Approach

In my previous setup, changing parameters like learning rate, LoRA configurations, or even the dataset splits 
required changes into the code. 
This not only made experimentation cumbersome but also increased the risk of inadvertently breaking something. 
With TRLParser, we can decouple parameters from our core training logic.

By moving all configurable parameters into a YAML file, the main training script remains clean and focused on the workflow:
  
```python
# Parse configuration from YAML into three dataclasses:
# ModelConfig, our custom ScriptArguments, and SFTConfig.
parser = TrlParser((ModelConfig, ScriptArguments, SFTConfig))
model_args, script_args, training_args = parser.parse_args_and_config()
```

This snippet is a game-changer. Now, if we want to test different fine-tuning strategies, we simply change 
values in the YAML configuration—no need to touch the underlying Python code.

## Benefits for Automation and MLOps

This modular approach opens up a world of opportunities for automation and MLOps:
  
- **Rapid Experimentation:** Quickly test different configurations by swapping out YAML files. This minimizes manual errors and speeds up iteration.
- **Pipeline Integration:** Easily integrate our fine-tuning workflow into larger CI/CD pipelines. Since configuration is externalized, automated systems can programmatically adjust parameters without any code changes.
- **Improved Collaboration:** With clear separation of code and configuration, team members can collaborate more effectively. Data scientists can tweak experiment parameters while engineers maintain the robust training framework.

## A Glimpse at Our YAML Configuration

Here's a snippet from the YAML configuration, which defines everything from model parameters to training arguments:

```yaml
# Model arguments
model_name_or_path: "Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat"
model_revision: "main"
torch_dtype: "bfloat16"
attn_implementation: "flash_attention_2"
load_in_4bit: true

# Script arguments
dataset_id_or_path: "gsantopaolo/faa-balloon-flying-handbook"
train_split: "train"
validation_split: "validation"
system_message: |
  answer the given balloon flying handbook question by providing a clear, detailed explanation...
fine_tune_tag: "faa-balloon-flying-handbook"
cache_dir: "cache"
upload_to_hf: false

# Training arguments
num_train_epochs: 1
per_device_train_batch_size: 2
gradient_accumulation_steps: 2
learning_rate: 4e-5
max_seq_length: 1024
...
```


## Conclusion

Using TRLParser to decouple the configuration from our fine-tuning code has been a 
transformative experience. 
The cleaner codebase and enhanced flexibility now allow us to focus on building better models 
and deploying robust MLOps pipelines. 
If you’re looking to streamline your own fine-tuning experiments, give TRLParser a try!
