I recently tried a fun experiment: I asked an image model to generate a **half eagle half lion creature**.
Then I ran the same image through two top-tier classifiers.

A classic **ResNet** (CNN) called it a **macaw**.
A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** called it an **Egyptian cat**.

Same pixels. Two different interpretations.

That tiny mismatch is a great doorway into a much bigger shift in deep learning:
**Transformers aren’t just replacing CNNs. They already replaced most RNN-era defaults in NLP, 
and they’re increasingly becoming a general-purpose backbone across modalities.** 
The original Transformer paper explicitly introduced an architecture that **dispenses with recurrence and convolutions** for sequence transduction and shows strong results with far better parallelism. ([From Attention to Prediction: The Transformer Workflow Explained][https://genmind.ch/posts/From-Attention-to-Prediction-The-Transformer-Workflow-Explained/])

## 1. The old pillars: RNNs for sequence, CNNs for vision

For years, deep learning had an elegant division of labor:

* **RNNs/LSTMs** handled language and time series.
* **CNNs** owned images.

Both were successful because they embedded strong assumptions about their inputs.

But the modern AI landscape now rewards architectures that can scale, transfer, and unify modalities. That’s where Transformers thrive.

## 2. Transformers vs RNNs: the NLP takeover

RNNs were built for sequences, but they have a fundamental limitation:
**time steps are processed sequentially**, which restricts parallelism.

The Transformer changed that by replacing recurrence with self-attention, enabling **much faster training** and stronger results for tasks like machine translation. This was not a subtle claim — the paper states its architecture replaces the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder systems. ([NeurIPS Papers][2])

This shift unlocked the era of large-scale pretraining and made Transformer-based language models the default foundation for modern NLP.

## 3. CNNs are brilliant… and biased on purpose

CNNs were engineered for images. Their core tool—the convolution—encodes a specific worldview:

1. **Locality**
2. **Translation invariance/equivariance**
3. **Hierarchy**

This inductive bias is why CNNs dominated for so long.
It’s also why they can be strangely “texture-hungry.”

In the feather-cat example, a CNN can overweight the **macaw-like texture** and underweight the **cat-like global structure**.

## 4. Vision Transformers formalized the turning point: scale wins

The ViT paper made a very clear, honest argument:

* **On mid-sized datasets like ImageNet without strong regularization, ViT is a few points below comparable ResNets**, which the authors attribute to missing image-specific inductive biases like locality and translation equivariance. 
* **But with large-scale pretraining** (ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M), the picture flips:
  the authors conclude that **large scale training trumps inductive bias**. 

Their best reported results include **88.55% on ImageNet** and **94.55% on CIFAR-100**, with strong performance on VTAB. 
They also show that **Vision Transformers generally outperform ResNets with the same pretraining compute** in their controlled scaling study, and that hybrids help at smaller sizes. 

This is a key modern lesson:

> As data and compute grow, architectures with fewer baked-in assumptions can win.

## 5. Attention can emulate convolution—and then go beyond it

Self-attention offers something convolution can’t do natively:

* **global context in a single step**
* flexible, content-dependent feature mixing

The ViT authors even note that in ViT, self-attention layers are **global**, and only parts of the model are local/translation-friendly, meaning far less image-specific bias than CNNs. 

Empirically, they show some attention heads already integrate information across large image regions in early layers, with attention distance increasing with depth.

## 6. Hardware loves what Transformers do

I won’t go deep here because I already did that deep dive.
If you want the full “why,” see:

[Why GPUs Love Tensors: Understanding Tensor Cores](https://genmind.ch/posts/Why-GPUs-Love-Tensors-Understanding-Tensor-Cores/)

The short framing for this post:
Transformers are dominated by large matrix multiplications that scale cleanly on modern accelerators — one more reason they became the go-to architecture across domains. ([NeurIPS Papers][2])

## 7. Multimodality made a unified backbone inevitable

Modern AI products increasingly need to process:

* text
* images
* audio
* video

Transformers provide a natural “tokenization story” for all of them, making a single architecture practical for cross-modal reasoning. This trend is reflected in broad overviews of Transformers’ growing role across vision and other domains. ([ACM Digital Library][3])

## 8. Are CNNs (and RNNs) dead?

Not at all.

* **CNNs** remain excellent when data is limited or deployment is tight (mobile/edge).
* **RNN-style models** still appear in niche or efficiency-focused settings.

Even the ViT paper reinforces that **convolutional inductive bias helps on smaller pretraining datasets**, while ViT benefits more as data grows. 

So this isn’t a funeral. It’s a rebalancing of defaults.

## Practical takeaways for builders

If you’re choosing architectures today:

* **Small/medium data + strict latency/edge constraints**
  CNNs (or light hybrid designs) are often still the best engineering answer. 

* **Large-scale pretraining + transfer-heavy roadmap**
  ViT-style models can be a better long-term bet. 

* **General-purpose vision backbone across tasks**
  Hierarchical Transformers like **Swin** were designed precisely for this, showing strong results in classification and dense prediction while addressing multiscale vision needs. ([arXiv][4])

## Closing thought

The feather-cat example looks like a classifier mistake.
But it’s really a window into architectural philosophy.

**CNNs are expert specialists.**
**Transformers are adaptable generalists.**

And as the AI world shifts toward **scale, transfer, and multimodality**,
generalists are increasingly becoming the default.
