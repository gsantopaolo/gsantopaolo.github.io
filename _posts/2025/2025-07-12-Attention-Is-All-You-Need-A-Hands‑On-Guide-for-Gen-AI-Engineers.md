## Summary
As part of my study for the [Artificial Intelligence Professional Program at Stanford](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program), 
I'm studying [CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs224n-natural-language-processing-deep-learning).
In this class, we studied the history of LLM models [from N-grams to RNNs](https://genmind.ch/posts/Mastering-Language-Modeling-From-N-grams-to-RNNs-and-Beyond/), 
and we are now
approaching the Transformer architecture, after having going through key concepts like [attention](https://genmind.ch/posts/Beyond-the-Thought-Vector-The-Evolution-of-Attention-in-Deep-Learning/) 
and [backpropagation through time](https://genmind.ch/posts/Yes-You-Should-Understand-Backprop-A-Step-by-Step-Walkthrough/).
<br/>
 
In this post, I'll try trace the evolution from RNNs to the attention‚Äëonly Transformer architecture, 
highlighting how self‚Äëattention overcomes linear interaction distance ([apxml.com][1], [Medium][2]) 
and non‚Äëparallelizable sequential computation bottlenecks ([EECS Department][3]). 
I'll also try to explain the scaled dot‚Äëproduct attention mechanism step‚Äëby‚Äëstep, 
including dimensional analysis ([itobos.eu][4], [Educative][5]), 
explain positional encoding techniques (sinusoidal and learned) 
for injecting sequence order ([Medium][6], [MachineLearningMastery.com][7]), 
and detail the core building blocks‚Äîmulti‚Äëhead attention ([GeeksforGeeks][8], [Deep Learning Indaba][9]), 
residual connections, and layer normalization ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research][10], [MachineLearningMastery.com][11]). 
With that done I can then talk about the encoder‚Äëdecoder framework, 
provide a runnable PyTorch implementation of a minimal Transformer layer ([PyTorch][12]), 
compare RNN vs. Transformer performance in throughput and BLEU score improvements ([arXiv][13], [arXiv][14]), 
and survey efficient attention variants (Reformer, Performer) and applications to vision (ViT) ([arXiv][15]) a
nd music generation ([arXiv][16]).

## 1. Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) model sequences by passing a hidden state from one 
time step to the next, but struggle to capture dependencies between tokens 
separated by many steps due to vanishing/exploding gradients and linear memory 
bottlenecks ([apxml.com][1]). 
Long Short‚ÄëTerm Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
architectures alleviate some gradient issues, 
but still require O(n) sequential operations that cannot be fully 
parallelized on GPUs ([Medium][2]).
As a result, even optimized RNN implementations suffer from high latency or poor 
scalability on modern hardware ([EECS Department][3]).

>üí°Imagine Chef Marina in her kitchen, she must remember each recipe step from appetizers to dessert, 
but if her memory of the soup‚Äôs seasoning fades by dinnertime, the final course suffers from 
‚Äúvanishing gradients,‚Äù the same issue that plagues traditional RNNs when learning long‚Äërange dependencies
<br/>
Gated architectures like LSTM and GRU act like recipe cards with built‚Äëin reminders‚Äîinput, 
forget, and output gates‚Äîto preserve crucial cooking steps over long ‚Äútime‚Äù spans, yet they 
still must be read one after another, enforcing an O(sequence length) sequential ritual that CPUs and GPUs cannot parallelize
<br/>
Waiters start demanding faster service (longer sequences), this one‚Äëat‚Äëa‚Äëtime approach causes high 
<br?>
latency and poor scalability, much like a single chef vs. a brigade working in parallel.
<br/>
Worse, if Marina relies on an ingredient she used a hundred dishes earlier, 
she must mentally retrace every intermediate step‚Äîan analogy for RNNs‚Äô linear interaction distance, 
which makes distant tokens interact only through many nonlinear transitions.
<br/>
Modern GPUs, designed to chop hundreds of vegetables at once, sit idle during these sequential passes, 
highlighting RNNs‚Äô poor parallelism on parallel hardware 
<br/>
.
Self‚Äëattention, by contrast, lets each ‚Äúsous‚Äëchef‚Äù query any recipe card directly in one shot‚Äîovercoming 
both vanishing gradients and sequential delays, and empowering the Transformer to serve complex ‚Äúmenus‚Äù 
at scale across NLP, vision, and beyond.

## 2. From RNN/LSTM + Attention to Pure Self‚ÄëAttention

Adding an attention layer to an encoder‚Äìdecoder LSTM lets the decoder flexibly attend to encoder states, 
reducing the information bottleneck of compressing a sequence into a single vector ([Medium][17], [Wikipedia][18]). 
However, this hybrid approach still processes tokens sequentially, limiting training and inference speed. 
The Transformer architecture dispenses with recurrence entirely, 
relying solely on self‚Äëattention to model token interactions in O(1) ‚Äúhops‚Äù regardless of 
distance ([arXiv][14]).

>üí°Imagine Chef Marina scribbling an entire seven‚Äëcourse menu onto a single page of her 
notebook-only to later struggle to read her cramped notes, 
overlapping notes and forget which dish used which spice. 
> This mirrors how a basic RNN compresses a whole input sequence into one fixed‚Äësize vector 
and then struggles to recall distant dependencies

## 3. Derivation of Scaled Dot‚ÄëProduct Self‚ÄëAttention

Given token embeddings $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, we learn three projection 
matrices $W^Q,W^K,W^V\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ to produce queries $Q=XW^Q$, keys $K=XW^K$, 
and values $V=XW^V$ ([itobos.eu][4]). 
The attention scores between each query‚Äìkey pair are computed as

$$
  \alpha_{ij} = \frac{(QK^\top)_{ij}}{\sqrt{d_k}},
$$

and normalized via softmax row‚Äëwise:

$$
  \mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}\!\Bigl(\tfrac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Bigr)\,V.
$$

Scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$ stabilizes gradients when $d_k$ is large ([Educative][5], [AI Mind][19]).

_Scaled Dot‚ÄëProduct Attention, source: [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7)_



Here‚Äôs a concise, chef‚Äëthemed explanation of **scaled dot‚Äëproduct self‚Äëattention**, with every sentence backed by diverse sources:

> üí°Imagine Chef Marina standing before a long spice rack (the ‚Äúvalues‚Äù) with each jar tagged by a 
> flavor profile (the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù) and her tasting spoon representing the current dish‚Äôs flavor preference (the ‚Äúquery‚Äù) ([AI Mind][1], [KiKaBeN][2]).
> She measures how well her spoon‚Äôs flavor matches each jar by taking the dot‚Äëproduct of their taste fingerprints‚Äîjust like computing the matrix product $QK^\top$ to score compatibility between queries and keys ([Medium][3], [d2l.ai][4]).
> To prevent any single spice from dominating when the flavor profiles are high‚Äëdimensional, Marina divides each raw score by $\sqrt{d_k}$, analogous to scaling dot‚Äëproducts by $\sqrt{d_k}$ for stable gradients in large $d_k$ ([Reddit][5], [Wikipedia][6]).
> Next, she conducts a ‚Äútaste test‚Äù by applying softmax to these scaled scores‚Äîturning them into weights that sum to¬†1‚Äîso she knows precisely how much of each spice to blend based on their relative match ([Cross Validated][7], [d2l.ai][4]).
> Finally, Marina scoops out the weighted mix of spices (the value vectors) and combines them into her final dish, just as
>
> $$
>   \mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}\!\bigl(\tfrac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\bigr)V
> $$
>
> produces the context‚Äëaware output for each query ([Wikipedia][8]).

## 4. Positional Encoding Techniques

Since self‚Äëattention is permutation‚Äëinvariant, we inject order via positional encodings added to token embeddings. **Sinusoidal encodings** define

$$
  \mathrm{PE}_{\!(\mathrm{pos},2i)} \!=\! \sin\!\bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{pos}}{10000^{2i/d}}\bigr),\quad
  \mathrm{PE}_{\!(\mathrm{pos},2i+1)} \!=\! \cos\!\bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{pos}}{10000^{2i/d}}\bigr),
$$

capturing relative offsets through linear transformations of periodic functions ([Medium][6], [Medium][20]). **Learned absolute encodings** instead optimize a $n\times d$ matrix as parameters, offering flexibility at the cost of fixed maximum sequence length ([MachineLearningMastery.com][7]).

## 5. Building Depth: Multi‚ÄëHead Attention, Residuals & LayerNorm

**Multi‚Äëhead attention** runs $h$ parallel attention heads, each with its own 
projections $W_i^Q,W_i^K,W_i^V$, then concatenates and projects:

$$
  \mathrm{head}_i = \mathrm{Attention}(XW_i^Q,XW_i^K,XW_i^V),\quad
  \mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)=\mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head}_1,\dots,\mathrm{head}_h)\,W^O.
$$

This enables the model to capture diverse relationships across 
subspaces ([GeeksforGeeks][8], [Deep Learning Indaba][9]).

To stabilize and deepen the network, each sublayer employs 
**residual connections** and **layer normalization**:

$$
  \mathrm{SublayerOut} = \mathrm{LayerNorm}\bigl(x + \mathrm{Sublayer}(x)\bigr),
$$

_Residual connection and LayerNorm around each attention/FFN, source: [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7)_


where LayerNorm normalizes across features 
$v\mapsto\gamma\frac{v-\mu}{\sigma}+\beta$ and 
significantly improves gradient flow in deep 

stacks ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research][10], [MachineLearningMastery.com][11]).

> (residual connection) and standardizes the mixture (LayerNorm) so 
> every batch tastes consistent before moving on.

## 7. Code Example: Minimal PyTorch Transformer Block

Below is a self‚Äëcontained PyTorch implementation of one Transformer encoder layer 
(self‚Äëattention + feed‚Äëforward + norms + residuals). You can also leverage `torch.nn.Transformer` 
in PyTorch‚Äôs standard library ([PyTorch][12]).

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

class SimpleTransformerLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model=512, nhead=8, dim_ff=2048, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, nhead, dropout=dropout)
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, dim_ff)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(dim_ff, d_model)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.act = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: shape (seq_len, batch, d_model)
        attn_out, _ = self.self_attn(x, x, x)
        x = self.norm1(x + attn_out)
        ff = self.linear2(self.dropout(self.act(self.linear1(x))))
        return self.norm2(x + ff)
```
