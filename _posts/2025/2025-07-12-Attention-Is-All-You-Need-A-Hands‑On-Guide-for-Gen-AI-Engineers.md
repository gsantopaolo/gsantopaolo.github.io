## Summary

In this post, we trace the evolution from recurrent RNNs and LSTMs to the attention‑only Transformer architecture, highlighting how self‑attention overcomes linear interaction distance ([apxml.com][1], [Medium][2]) and non‑parallelizable sequential computation bottlenecks ([EECS Department][3]). We derive the scaled dot‑product attention mechanism step‑by‑step, including dimensional analysis ([itobos.eu][4], [Educative][5]), explain positional encoding techniques (sinusoidal and learned) for injecting sequence order ([Medium][6], [MachineLearningMastery.com][7]), and detail the core building blocks—multi‑head attention ([GeeksforGeeks][8], [Deep Learning Indaba][9]), residual connections, and layer normalization ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research][10], [MachineLearningMastery.com][11]). We then introduce the encoder‑decoder framework, provide a runnable PyTorch implementation of a minimal Transformer layer ([PyTorch][12]), compare RNN vs. Transformer performance in throughput and BLEU score improvements ([arXiv][13], [arXiv][14]), and survey efficient attention variants (Reformer, Performer) and applications to vision (ViT) ([arXiv][15]) and music generation ([arXiv][16]).

## 1. Introduction

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model sequences by passing a hidden state from one time step to the next, but struggle to capture dependencies between tokens separated by many steps due to vanishing/exploding gradients and linear memory bottlenecks ([apxml.com][1]). Long Short‑Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures alleviate some gradient issues, but still require O(n) sequential operations that cannot be fully parallelized on GPUs ([Medium][2]). As a result, even optimized RNN implementations suffer from high latency or poor scalability on modern hardware ([EECS Department][3]).

## 2. From RNN/LSTM + Attention to Pure Self‑Attention

Adding an attention layer to an encoder–decoder LSTM lets the decoder flexibly attend to encoder states, reducing the information bottleneck of compressing a sequence into a single vector ([Medium][17], [Wikipedia][18]). However, this hybrid approach still processes tokens sequentially, limiting training and inference speed. The Transformer architecture dispenses with recurrence entirely, relying solely on self‑attention to model token interactions in O(1) “hops” regardless of distance ([arXiv][14]).

## 3. Derivation of Scaled Dot‑Product Self‑Attention

Given token embeddings $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, we learn three projection matrices $W^Q,W^K,W^V\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ to produce queries $Q=XW^Q$, keys $K=XW^K$, and values $V=XW^V$ ([itobos.eu][4]). The attention scores between each query–key pair are computed as

$$
  \alpha_{ij} = \frac{(QK^\top)_{ij}}{\sqrt{d_k}},
$$

and normalized via softmax row‑wise:

$$
  \mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \mathrm{softmax}\!\Bigl(\tfrac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Bigr)\,V.
$$

Scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$ stabilizes gradients when $d_k$ is large ([Educative][5], [AI Mind][19]).

## 4. Positional Encoding Techniques

Since self‑attention is permutation‑invariant, we inject order via positional encodings added to token embeddings. **Sinusoidal encodings** define

$$
  \mathrm{PE}_{\!(\mathrm{pos},2i)} \!=\! \sin\!\bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{pos}}{10000^{2i/d}}\bigr),\quad
  \mathrm{PE}_{\!(\mathrm{pos},2i+1)} \!=\! \cos\!\bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{pos}}{10000^{2i/d}}\bigr),
$$

capturing relative offsets through linear transformations of periodic functions ([Medium][6], [Medium][20]). **Learned absolute encodings** instead optimize a $n\times d$ matrix as parameters, offering flexibility at the cost of fixed maximum sequence length ([MachineLearningMastery.com][7]).

---

## 5. Building Depth: Multi‑Head Attention, Residuals & LayerNorm

**Multi‑head attention** runs $h$ parallel attention heads, each with its own 
projections $W_i^Q,W_i^K,W_i^V$, then concatenates and projects:

$$
  \mathrm{head}_i = \mathrm{Attention}(XW_i^Q,XW_i^K,XW_i^V),\quad
  \mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)=\mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head}_1,\dots,\mathrm{head}_h)\,W^O.
$$

This enables the model to capture diverse relationships across 
subspaces ([GeeksforGeeks][8], [Deep Learning Indaba][9]).

To stabilize and deepen the network, each sublayer employs 
**residual connections** and **layer normalization**:

$$
  \mathrm{SublayerOut} = \mathrm{LayerNorm}\bigl(x + \mathrm{Sublayer}(x)\bigr),
$$

where LayerNorm normalizes across features 
$v\mapsto\gamma\frac{v-\mu}{\sigma}+\beta$ and 
significantly improves gradient flow in deep 

stacks ([Proceedings of Machine Learning Research][10], [MachineLearningMastery.com][11]).

## 7. Code Example: Minimal PyTorch Transformer Block

Below is a self‑contained PyTorch implementation of one Transformer encoder layer (self‑attention + feed‑forward + norms + residuals). You can also leverage `torch.nn.Transformer` in PyTorch’s standard library ([PyTorch][12]).

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

class SimpleTransformerLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model=512, nhead=8, dim_ff=2048, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, nhead, dropout=dropout)
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, dim_ff)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(dim_ff, d_model)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.act = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: shape (seq_len, batch, d_model)
        attn_out, _ = self.self_attn(x, x, x)
        x = self.norm1(x + attn_out)
        ff = self.linear2(self.dropout(self.act(self.linear1(x))))
        return self.norm2(x + ff)
```
