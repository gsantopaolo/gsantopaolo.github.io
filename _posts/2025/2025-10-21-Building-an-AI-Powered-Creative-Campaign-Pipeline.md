The marketing automation problem hasn't changed: creative teams spend days generating localized ad variants across markets and formats. A single campaign with 2 products √ó 4 locales √ó 4 aspect ratios = **32 unique assets**. Each needs culturally-appropriate copy, branded visuals, and format-specific composition.

**CreativeCampaign-Agent** automates this end-to-end using event-driven microservices and OpenAI APIs. From campaign brief to production-ready assets in under 10 minutes.

**GitHub:** [github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent)

## The Problem: Manual Creative Work Doesn't Scale

Imagine you're launching a beauty campaign across 4 markets (EN, DE, FR, IT) with 2 products and 4 aspect ratios (1:1, 4:5, 9:16, 16:9). That's **32 unique creative assets**. Each needs:

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Localized copy** respecting cultural nuances and legal guidelines
- üé® **Product images** optimized for each aspect ratio
- üè∑Ô∏è **Brand elements** (logo, colors) intelligently placed
- üìù **Text overlays** positioned for maximum impact

**Manual approach:**
- Creative team: 2 days writing localized copy
- Designers: 3 days positioning logos and exporting variants  
- QA: 1 day checking brand compliance

**Total:** 6+ days, $5,000-$10,000, zero scalability.

---

## The Solution: Event-Driven AI Pipeline

CreativeCampaign-Agent automates the entire workflow:

- **GPT-4o-mini** for cultural context, creative copy, and AI vision-based logo placement
- **DALL-E 3** for aspect-ratio-optimized product images
- **NATS JetStream** for reliable event-driven orchestration
- **MongoDB + S3** for persistence
- **Docker Compose** for one-command deployment

**Result:** 32 variants in **under 10 minutes**, ~$1.20 in API costs.

```

**Five specialized services**, each with a single responsibility. Let's walk through the pipeline.

---

## Service 1: Context Enricher

**Purpose:** Generate locale-specific cultural insights to inform creative generation.

### What It Does

For each locale, it generates:
- Cultural notes and sensitivities
- Appropriate messaging tone
- Visual style preferences  
- Do's and don'ts for the market
- Legal/compliance guidelines

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant NATS as NATS JetStream
    participant CE as Context Enricher
    participant OpenAI as OpenAI<br/>(GPT-4o-mini)
    participant DB as MongoDB

    API->>NATS: Publish context.enrich.request
    Note over API: campaign_id: "summer-2025"<br/>locale: "de"<br/>region: "DACH"
    
    NATS->>CE: Deliver message
    
    CE->>CE: Build LLM prompt
    Note over CE: Include audience, age range,<br/>region, products
    
    CE->>OpenAI: Generate context pack
    OpenAI-->>CE: Cultural insights (JSON)

  "locale": "de",
  "culture_notes": "DACH region values precision, quality, and scientific backing. Consumers are detail-oriented and appreciate transparency in ingredients and manufacturing processes.",
  "tone": "professional yet approachable",
  "dos": [
    "Emphasize product quality and efficacy",
    "Use formal 'Sie' initially",
    "Highlight natural ingredients with specifics"
  ],
  "donts": [
    "Avoid overly casual language",
    "Don't make unsubstantiated health claims",
    "Avoid aggressive sales tactics"
  ],
  "legal_guidelines": "Must comply with EU cosmetics regulations..."
}
```

**Code:** [src/context_enricher/main.py](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/blob/main/src/context_enricher/main.py)

---

## Service 2: Creative Generator

**Purpose:** Generate localized creative content in the target language using the enriched context.

### What It Does

Generates in the target language:
- Catchy headline (5-15 words)
- Campaign description (50-100 words)
- Call-to-action (3-8 words)
- Suggested visual elements

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

    CG->>OpenAI: Generate creative content
    OpenAI-->>CG: Structured JSON (German text)
    
    CG->>CG: Validate with Pydantic
    
    CG->>DB: Save creative content
    
    CG->>NATS: Publish creative.generate.done
    
    CG->>NATS: ACK
```

### Example Output (German)

```json
{
  "headline": "Nat√ºrliche Sch√∂nheit jeden Tag",
  "description": "Entdecken Sie unsere premium Hautpflege-Kollektion mit nat√ºrlichen Inhaltsstoffen. Vitamin C Serum und Hydration Cream f√ºr strahlende, gesunde Haut. Wissenschaftlich getestet, dermatologisch best√§tigt.",
  "call_to_action": "Jetzt entdecken",
  "visual_elements": ["Nat√ºrliche Inhaltsstoffe", "Elegante Produktverpackung"]
}
```

**Key:** All content is in the **target language** (German), respecting cultural context from the enricher.

**Code:** [src/creative_generator/main.py](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/blob/main/src/creative_generator/main.py)

---

## Service 3: Image Generator

**Purpose:** Generate product images using DALL-E 3 with aspect-ratio-specific prompts.

### What It Does

Generates **4 images per locale**, each optimized for its aspect ratio:
- **1x1** - Square (Instagram feed) - centered composition
- **4x5** - Portrait (Instagram) - vertical flow, product in upper portion
- **9x16** - Story (Instagram/TikTok) - dramatic vertical, product top/center
- **16x9** - Landscape (YouTube) - wide cinematic, product left or right

Each format gets **customized composition guidance** in the DALL-E prompt.

### Sequence Diagram

        IG->>IG: Build aspect-specific prompt
        Note over IG: 1x1: "centered composition"<br/>9x16: "vertical story format"
        
        IG->>OpenAI: Generate image
        Note over IG,OpenAI: Size: 1024x1024,<br/>1024x1792, or 1792x1024

        IG->>S3: Upload
        Note over IG,S3: campaigns/{id}/{locale}/<br/>{aspect}/generated_*.png
        
        IG->>DB: Save metadata
        
        IG->>NATS: Publish image.generated
        Note over IG,NATS: One event per aspect ratio
    end
    
    IG->>NATS: ACK
```

### Aspect-Ratio-Specific Prompts

```python
# Each aspect ratio gets different composition guidance
composition_guidance = {
    "1x1": "centered composition with balanced symmetry, product prominently displayed in middle third",
    "4x5": "vertical portrait composition with product in upper two-thirds, space at bottom for text",
    "9x16": "tall vertical story format with product in center or upper portion, generous bottom space",
    "16x9": "wide horizontal landscape with product positioned left or right, space for text on opposite side"
}
```

**Critical:** Images have **NO text** (text overlay happens later) and leave strategic space for logo (top half) and text (bottom half).

**Code:** [src/image_generator/main.py](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/blob/main/src/image_generator/main.py)

---

## Service 4: Brand Composer (AI Logo Placement)

**Purpose:** Add brand logo using **GPT-4o-mini Vision** to intelligently determine optimal placement.

### The Innovation: AI Vision for Logo Placement

Traditional systems use fixed positions ("top-right corner"). This can cover products, faces, or look unnatural.

**CreativeCampaign-Agent uses AI vision analysis:**
1. Sends image to GPT-4o-mini Vision
2. AI analyzes image composition, identifies products/faces/focal points
3. AI finds empty space with good contrast in **upper 50%** (text goes in bottom 50%)
4. Returns position, size, and **detailed reasoning**

### Sequence Diagram

    BC->>NATS: ACK
```

### AI Vision Prompt (Simplified)

```
Analyze this {width}x{height}px product image.

CONSTRAINT: Logo MUST be in UPPER HALF (y < 50%) because text goes at bottom.

Find optimal logo position that:
1. Doesn't cover products, faces, or key elements
2. Has good contrast and visibility
3. Feels natural and professional

Scan upper half, identify:
- Visual elements and pixel locations
- Empty spaces suitable for logo
- Best position: top-left, top-right, or top-center

Return JSON:
{
  "position": "top_right",
  "x_percent": 0.85,
  "y_percent": 0.12,
  "scale": 0.12,
  "reasoning": "Top-right corner (x=870-980px, y=50-150px) has plain background. Product centered at 400-700px. Logo at scale 0.12 (123px) ensures visibility without obscuring elements."
}
```

### Example AI Response

```json
{
  "position": "top_right",
  "x_percent": 0.85,
  "y_percent": 0.12,
  "scale": 0.12,
  "reasoning": "Top-right corner identified as optimal placement (x=870-980px, y=50-150px). Plain light background provides excellent contrast. Product imagery centered at 300-700px, face at 400-600px. Placing logo at (870, 123) with 12% scale ensures brand visibility without obscuring key visual elements. Confirmed y=123px is in top 12%."
}
```

**Why AI instead of rules?**
- ‚úÖ Analyzes actual image content
- ‚úÖ Adapts to each unique composition
- ‚úÖ Finds empty spaces automatically
- ‚úÖ Considers contrast
- ‚úÖ Provides transparent reasoning

**Cost:** ~$0.001 per image (~$0.032 for 32 variants)

**Code:** [src/brand_composer/main.py](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/blob/main/src/brand_composer/main.py)

---

## Service 5: Text Overlay

**Purpose:** Add localized campaign text to branded images and export final assets.

### What It Does

1. Extracts headline from creative content
2. Downloads branded image from S3
3. Calculates text placement (**code-based**, not AI - bottom is predictable)
4. Renders text with semi-transparent background
5. Uploads final asset to S3
6. Marks campaign as "completed" when all locales/aspects done

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

    TO->>S3: Download branded image
    S3-->>TO: Image data
    
    TO->>TO: Calculate text placement
    Note over TO: Bottom middle, 80% width,<br/>font size based on text length
    
    TO->>TO: Wrap text to fit
    
    TO->>TO: Draw semi-transparent background
    Note over TO: Dark box, 70% opacity
    
    TO->>TO: Render text with outline
    Note over TO: White text, black outline,<br/>centered alignment
    
    TO->>S3: Upload final image
    Note over TO,S3: campaigns/{id}/{locale}/<br/>{aspect}/final_*.png
    
    TO->>DB: Update campaign.outputs
    
    TO->>DB: Check if all complete
    
    alt All locales/aspects done
        TO->>DB: Mark campaign "completed"
    end
    
    TO->>NATS: Publish text.overlaid
    
    TO->>NATS: ACK
```

### Text Placement Algorithm

```python
def calculate_bottom_middle_placement(width, height, text):
    # Font size: 5% of image width, adjusted for text length
    base_font_size = int(width * 0.05)
    font_size = adjust_for_length(base_font_size, len(text))
    
    # Box: 80% width, centered
    box_width = int(width * 0.8)
    box_x = (width - box_width) // 2
    
    # Position: 5% margin from bottom
    margin_bottom = int(height * 0.05)
    box_y = height - box_height - margin_bottom
    
    return {
        "box_x": box_x,
        "box_y": box_y,
        "font_size": font_size,
        "text_color": "#FFFFFF",  # White
        "background_opacity": 0.7,  # Semi-transparent dark
        "alignment": "center"
    }
```

**Why code-based (not AI)?**
- ‚úÖ Logo already cleared bottom space (AI placed it in top half)
- ‚úÖ Text always goes at bottom (predictable)
- ‚úÖ Faster (no API call)
- ‚úÖ $0 cost
- ‚úÖ Consistent results

**Code:** [src/text_overlay/main.py](https://github.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/blob/main/src/text_overlay/main.py)

## Event-Driven Architecture: Why NATS?

### The Challenge

In a creative pipeline, steps take 5-60 seconds:
- Context enrichment: 5-10s
- Creative generation: 8-15s
- Image generation: 30-60s (DALL-E)
- Brand composition: 5-10s
- Text overlay: 3-5s

Sequential = **50-100s per asset**. For 32 assets: **25-50 minutes**. Unacceptable.

### The Solution: Parallel Event Processing

NATS JetStream enables:
- **Async by default** - don't block API
- **Parallel processing** - multiple locales at once
- **Automatic retries** - up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Dead Letter Queue** - failed messages for investigation
- **Horizontal scaling** - queue groups distribute load

```python
# Service subscribes with retry policy
subscriber = JetStreamEventSubscriber(
    subject="creative.generate.done",
    ack_wait=180,  # 3 minutes to process
    max_deliver=3,  # Retry 3 times on failure
)

async def handle_message(msg):
    try:
        result = await generate_image(msg.data)
        await publisher.publish(result)
        await msg.ack()  # Success
    except Exception as e:
        await msg.nak()  # Retry (up to 3 times)
        # After 3 failures ‚Üí Dead Letter Queue
```

### Scaling Example

```bash
# Scale image-generator to 5 replicas
docker-compose up -d --scale image-generator=5
```

NATS queue groups ensure each message processed by exactly one replica. **No coordination needed.**

---

## Production-Ready Patterns

### 1. Structured Logging

```python
logger.info("üöÄ Service starting...")
logger.info("‚úÖ Connected to NATS")
logger.info("ü§ñ Calling OpenAI DALL-E...")
logger.info("üì§ Uploaded to S3: s3://bucket/key")
logger.error("‚ùå Failed to process message")
```

**Emojis** make logs instantly scannable in Portainer/CloudWatch.

### 2. Health Checks

Every service exposes `/healthz`:

```python
class ReadinessProbe:
    def update_last_seen(self):
        self.last_seen = time.time()
    
    def is_ready(self) -> bool:
        return (time.time() - self.last_seen) < timeout
```

Docker healthcheck monitors liveness:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "-q", "http://localhost:8080/healthz"]
  interval: 10s
  retries: 3
```

### 3. Protobuf for Type Safety

```protobuf
message CreativeGenerateDone {
  string campaign_id = 1;
  string locale = 2;
  string correlation_id = 3;
  string timestamp = 4;
}
```

Type-safe contracts between services prevent runtime errors.

### 4. Graceful Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = await process(msg)
    await msg.ack()  # Success
except RetryableError:
    await msg.nak()  # Retry
except FatalError:
    await msg.term()  # Don't retry, send to DLQ
```

---

## Installation: Ridiculously Simple

**You don't even need to clone the repo.**

### Prerequisites
- Docker ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- OpenAI API key ([Get one](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Run in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Download runner script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsantopaolo/CreativeCampaign-Agent/main/deployment/run-creative-campaign.sh

# 2. Make executable
chmod +x run-creative-campaign.sh

# 3. Run with your OpenAI API key
./run-creative-campaign.sh sk-proj-YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY-HERE
```

**That's it.** The script:
1. üê≥ Pulls Docker image from Docker Hub
2. üöÄ Starts all services (API, workers, MongoDB, MinIO, NATS)
3. ‚ú® Waits for readiness
4. üåê Opens UI at http://localhost:8501

**Time to running system:** Under 2 minutes.

## Performance & Cost Analysis

### Time Comparison

| Task | Manual | Automated | Speedup |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Context research | 4 hours | 10 seconds | **1,440x** |
| Creative copy (4 locales) | 8 hours | 40 seconds | **720x** |
| Image generation (16 variants) | 2 days | 8 minutes | **360x** |
| Logo placement | 4 hours | 1 minute | **240x** |
| Text overlay | 2 hours | 30 seconds | **240x** |
| **Total** | **3-5 days** | **10 minutes** | **432-720x** |

### Cost Breakdown (32 variants)

- Context enrichment: $0.08 (GPT-4o-mini √ó 4 locales)
- Creative generation: $0.12 (GPT-4o-mini √ó 4 locales)
- Image generation: $1.28 (DALL-E 3 √ó 32 variants @ $0.04/image)
- Logo placement: $0.03 (GPT-4o-mini vision √ó 32)
- **Total: ~$1.50 per campaign**

Compare to manual: $5,000-$10,000.

**ROI:** 3,333x - 6,667x

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Right-Sized Microservices

Each service has **single responsibility**. Could this be a monolith? Yes. Should it? No‚Äîeach service scales independently.

Extract to microservice when:
- ‚úÖ Different resource requirements (GPU for images, CPU for text)
- ‚úÖ Independent scaling needs
- ‚úÖ Fault isolation (image generation fails ‚â† entire pipeline fails)

### 2. Orchestration in API Layer

Many systems use separate orchestration service. I embedded it in API gateway:
- ‚úÖ Simpler deployment
- ‚úÖ Lower latency
- ‚úÖ Sufficient for <10K campaigns/day

Extract when volume exceeds 10K/day.

### 3. AI Where It Adds Value

**AI-powered:**
- ‚úÖ Logo placement (every image is different)
- ‚úÖ Creative copy (cultural nuance required)
- ‚úÖ Context enrichment (market insights)

**Code-based:**
- ‚úÖ Text overlay (predictable, bottom placement)
- ‚úÖ S3 uploads (deterministic)

Don't use AI for everything. Use it where **intelligence adds value**.

## Final Thoughts

This isn't a toy demo‚Äîit's built like a real customer deployment. The architecture demonstrates production patterns you'd use at scale:

‚úÖ **Event-driven microservices** for independent scaling  
‚úÖ **AI-powered intelligence** where it adds value  
‚úÖ **Horizontal scaling** with NATS queue groups  
‚úÖ **Fault tolerance** (retries, health checks, DLQ)  
‚úÖ **Observable & reliable** (structured logs, metrics)  

Built in the spirit of a Forward Deployed Engineer's 2-day customer POC‚Äîshowing both technical depth and pragmatic engineering judgment.

If you're building AI-powered automation or event-driven systems, I hope this serves as a useful reference architecture.
