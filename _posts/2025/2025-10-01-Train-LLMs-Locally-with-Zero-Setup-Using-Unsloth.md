Training large language models (LLMs) locally has always come with a catch — endless dependency issues, tricky environment setups, and the dreaded “works on my machine” problem. But not anymore.

Unsloth AI just released an **official Docker image** 🐳 that makes local LLM training as simple as pulling and running a container. No more fiddling with CUDA versions, Python packages, or missing system libraries. Everything you need is packaged and ready to go.

## Why This Matters

If you’ve ever tried to set up an LLM training environment, you know the pain:

* Conflicting CUDA / GPU drivers
* Dependency hell with PyTorch, Transformers, and other libraries
* Hours wasted just to get a single notebook running

With Unsloth’s Docker image, those headaches are gone.

## What’s Inside

The image ships with:
✅ **All pre-made Unsloth notebooks** — ready to run instantly
✅ **Optimized environments** — no dependency clashes
✅ **GPU support** — take full advantage of your local hardware

This means you can go from zero to training in minutes.

## How to Get Started

1. Pull the image:

   ```bash
   docker pull unslothai/unsloth
   ```
2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -it unslothai/unsloth
   ```
3. Start experimenting with Unsloth notebooks right away.

That’s it. No setup. No troubleshooting. Just train.

### Final Thoughts

This is a huge step forward for anyone looking to train or fine-tune LLMs locally. With Docker, you don’t just avoid setup hassles—you also gain reproducibility, portability, and the freedom to experiment faster.

If you’ve been putting off LLM training because of the environment setup nightmare, now’s the time to jump in.
